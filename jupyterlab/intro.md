# First Steps in BOUT++

Officially this is the description of BOUT++

>BOUT++ is a framework for writing fluid and plasma simulations in curvilinear geometry. It is intended to be quite modular, with a variety of numerical methods and >time-integration solvers available. BOUT++ is primarily designed and tested with reduced plasma fluid models in mind, but it can evolve any number of equations, with >equations appearing in a readable form.
>Jointly developed by University of York (UK), LLNL, CCFE, DCU, DTU, and other international partners.

BOUT++ is `insert more accessible description`.

This software will help with `write something intelligent - ask Amy/Anna/Elena/Jacob/Johnny/Moritz`.

Starting out with it can be daunting - this is part of a series of tutorials to aid in getting to grips with BOUT++ - from installing and setting it up to using it in some simulations.

The first step will be to do a sandbox compilation in this JupyterLab to start to get use to what steps are needed for compiling the software.

Note that you have sudo capability in this JupyterLab - this is to allow installation of system pre-requisites for the compilation.

You will go through the following steps:

- [Installing Pre-requisites](step1.md)
- [Compiling BOUT++](step2.md)
- [Running Examples](step3.md)

## Where to Run

You should run the commands in the terminal in a JupyterLab command terminal.

Select the `File Menu`, select `New` then select `Terminal`

To have the instructions and terminal side by side, you can drag the terminal to the right of the screen and dock it when the shadow takes up half of the area. This means you can have the instructions and terminal visible. You can arrange this to your preference.
