# BOUT++ Tutorials

## Welcome to the Excalibur Tutorial Series on BOUT++

Excalibur in 2021 and 2022 have been working with the software package BOUT++. As part of this work, Excalibur has created a series of tutorials to get you started with BOUT++, from building and installing it to running some simulations using it.

## Container Sandbox Build

Working in Jupyterlab you can build BOUT++ in a container environment which will not corrupt your existing workspace. This is where to start if you have never attempted to buld BOUT++ or are unsure about the process.

Right Click on the file `jupyterinstall.juypterinstall.jupyterlab-workspace` in the file explorer to the right and click `Open With` -> `Workspace Loader`

## Larger Systems

Exaclibur has been testing BOUT++ on two larger HPC systems, [ARCHER2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/) and [CIRRUS](https://www.cirrus.ac.uk/).

Need blurb about there systems and similarities to other large systems.
